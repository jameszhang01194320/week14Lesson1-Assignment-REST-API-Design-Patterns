Task 1: Implement Factory Application Pattern
•	Configure the Flask application using the Factory Application Pattern to enable easy configuration and instantiation of the application.
•	Organize the application structure into modules for better code organization and maintainability.

Task 2: Utilize Flask Blueprints for Modular Design
•	Create Flask Blueprints to modularize different aspects of the factory management system, such as customer management,  product additions and removal, and the creation of orders.
•	Register these Blueprints with the Flask application to enable modularity and separation of concerns.
